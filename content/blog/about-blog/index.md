You've probably already heard all the buzz about Facebook recently rebranding as Meta. The corporate makeover was meant to signal that the company is looking to expand outwards from social media and into the so-called "metaverse."

## On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much

Last Monday, the digital world was rocked as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp all went down for an unprecedented amount of time (about 6 hours, but it felt like forever, didn't it?) due to a combination of factors involving human error as well as a code update that went awry and prevented Facebook from accessing its own data centers.

It's a no-brainer in 2021 --  many users use Facebook these days primarily as a way to find and consume content, encompassing everything from news articles to say, videos of the infamous talking, singing pumpkin. So when this avenue content discovery of  became unavailable, users went looking for new content elsewhere. But where did they go?

[Alphabet Village](http://google.com) and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.

### What did the Facebook outage reveal about online users?

Data shows that online users started to look at independent publishers that they trusted for news and entertainment. This led to as much as a 40% increase in traffic during the six hours that Facebook was down. While more established publishers saw a bigger increase in traffic, even smaller publishers managed to see a small increase in traffic as well.

The first is that, while Facebook is really good at keeping users on their platform when everything is running smoothly, outages force users to look to other sources for the content they're used to consuming. Once it became apparent that this latest outage might be a prolonged one, users had to move on quickly so that they wouldn't fall behind in the fast-moving, 24/7 cycle of content and information that is our modern digital world. 

### How can publishers reach their audience without social media?

While social media marketing can be a great tool for attracting an audience, publishers need to think deeper about other ways to build and sustain a relationship with them instead of only considering traffic numbers. Loyal relationships are key to ensuring long-term success, regardless of what's happening in the online world.
